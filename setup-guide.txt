# Notes: before running this script there are several steps that require
# user action, namely: setting up the correct user/password, creating 
# a partition for the NVMe drive (if present), and editing the configuration
# files to include the correct directory structure. We will over time look
# to automate much of this, but just be warned for now that there are steps
# where you will need to get your hands dirty. ;)

# 0. pre-setup
# fresh inistall of Nvidia Jetson JetPack
# create user: minit with pw: minit


# 1. get everything together before we start
# ensure in /home/minit dir
cd ~/
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/sirselim/jetson_nanopore_sequencing.git
cd ./jetson_nanopore_sequencing
# download guppy from ONT servers
# NOTE: minknow requires specific versions of guppy for live base calling, using the wrong version will result in crashes
# you can find an updated table of compatible versions here: https://github.com/sirselim/jetson_nanopore_sequencing#minknow--guppy-compatibility
# this is the latest version of guppy for the current Minknow in release (21.02.5, minknow-core 4.2.5)
wget https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont-guppy_4.3.4_linuxaarch64_cuda10.tar.gz
# extract required packages
tar -xzvf *_linuxaarch64_cuda10.tar.gz
unzip h5py.zip 


# 2. full system update and upgrade
# shouldn't take long with latest JetPack
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


#TODO - this is making assumptions about previously created partitions
# NOTE: you may not require this step, it depends on your storage setup
# 3. mount ssd (this should be properly done, place holder for now)
sudo mkdir /xavier_ssd
sudo mkdir /xavier_ssd/minknow
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /xavier_ssd/


# 4. add nanopore repo to system and update
sudo cp nanoporetech.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# add key
wget -O- https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/apt/ont-repo.pub | sudo apt-key add -
# update repos
sudo apt update


# 5. install ont packages
# this step is pulling from the latest ONT repo with minit packages
# if you are building from cached debs replace this step with 'dpkg -i *.deb'
# 6 packages required:
# - ont-bream4-minit 
# - ont-kingfisher-ui-minit 
# - ont-remote-support 
# - ont-system-identification 
# - ont-configuration-customer-minit 
# - minknow-core-minit-offline
# BUT we can use the predefined list of packages
cat ont-package-list-xavier.txt | xargs sudo apt-get install


# NOTE: this step has been modified after the release of guppy 4.2.2, which introduces guppy_basecall_client
# in place of the guppy_basecaller
# 6. copy guppy binaries to correct location, create sym links and check links and guppy version
sudo cp -r ont-guppy /opt/ont/
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller /usr/bin/guppy_basecaller
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecall_client /usr/bin/guppy_basecall_client
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecall_server /usr/bin/guppy_basecall_server
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller_supervisor /usr/bin/guppy_basecaller_supervisor
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_barcoder /usr/bin/guppy_barcoder
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_aligner /usr/bin/guppy_aligner
sudo ln -s /opt/ont/ont-guppy/bin/minimap2 /usr/bin/minimap2
# can check versions linked are correct
guppy_basecaller --version
guppy_basecall_server --version
guppy_aligner --version
guppy_barcoder --version
guppy_basecall_client --version
minimap2 --version


#TODO - tidy this step to make it more user friendly
# 7. edit the minknow conf files to change the location of data and check guppy paths and parameters
cd /opt/ont/minknow/conf
sudo nano user_conf 
sudo nano app_conf


# 8. install libhdf5-dev and copy across pre-compiled h5py (after removing old version)
# move back to git repo dir 
cd ~/jetson_nanopore_sequencing
sudo apt install libhdf5-dev
sudo rm -rf /opt/ont/minknow/ont-python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/h5py/
sudo cp -r h5py/ /opt/ont/minknow/ont-python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/


# 9. copy minknow.service for systemd set up and restart the service
sudo cp minknow.service /etc/systemd/system/
service minknow restart
# check
service minknow status
# can check that the services are running as root with htop


## optional steps

# install jetson-stats to allow nice hardware monitoring
# https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats
sudo -H pip install -U jetson-stats
# needs a reboot/logout and then can use jtop
